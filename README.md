# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I enjoyed the project a lot, it was good to see everything we could do ourselves. I had to use an extension as the holidays got really busy but overall I would say it was very enjoyful!
